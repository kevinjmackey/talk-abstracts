Drive your SSIS processes with metadata

You have flat files to load. They come in different sizes (but–happily–not shapes), at (almost) random times, and other processes depend on them being loaded.
How can you know where you are in the process? How can you ensure as much parallelism as possible? When do you know you're done?
This session looks at the patterns to use in assembling a generalized package set to accomplish the above. I know it works–because I had to build exactly this!
